Features:

Customizable Clock Face: The clock face is designed to resemble a traditional analog clock with hour labels and hands for hours, minutes, and seconds. Each component of the clock face is positioned dynamically using CSS transforms to ensure accurate time representation.

Dark Mode Toggle: The clock includes a dark mode toggle feature, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes based on their preference. The dark mode transforms the background and text colors to create a visually striking contrast, enhancing readability and reducing eye strain, especially in low-light environments.

Responsive Design: The clock is responsive and adjusts its layout and size to fit various screen sizes and device orientations. Flexbox and grid layout techniques are utilized to ensure the clock remains centered on the web page, regardless of the viewport dimensions.

Implementation:

HTML Structure: The clock is structured using HTML elements such as divs and labels to represent the clock face components.

CSS Styling: CSS is used to style the clock, including defining colors, shadows, borders, and positioning of clock elements. Media queries are employed to ensure responsiveness across different devices.

JavaScript Functionality: JavaScript is used to provide dynamic behavior to the clock, including updating the clock hands' rotation angles based on the current time and handling the dark mode toggle functionality.

Conclusion:

This clock project demonstrates the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and visually appealing timepiece with additional customization options. Whether used as a standalone web application or integrated into larger projects, this clock serves as an example of how frontend technologies can be combined to create interactive and engaging user experience
